# Mahabharata

Houses the Mahabhabharata BORI CE data in machine readable format.

Sourced from Bombay Indology Group (https://bombay.indology.info/mahabharata/welcome.html) in late 2023

Google translation data available for each verse through latest version of Google Translate API as of Nov 2023. Translations are mostly inaccurate but helpful in identifying keywords. Empty key `kmg_trans` available for each verse to house Kisari Mohan Ganguli's translation once it has been split and mapped onto the corresponding verse from BORI CE.
